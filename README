This is an effort to use EasyBuild as the installation method for NLPL modules. There are 
different easybuild setup on different systems. To list the configurations

´´´
eb --show-config 
´´´

To use the same procedure across different systems we are going to use a custom instructions
so things will end up in exactly you want and do not modified anything centrally installed.
To prepare directories and get the path settings run the following command

´´´
setdir.sh
´´´

The above script will print the MODULEPATH to set and the eb robot path to issue.

The current version do not perform the sanity check so the software need to be verified to
be working manually.

## efmaral
efmaral/1.0.0-foss-2018b-Python-3.6.6 is the first module to test. This uses a generic 
easyblock called “nlplpython.py”. The reason for using own easyblock is that the package
efmaral fails sanity check due to failing “import efmaral”. As the usage is through an 
egg or an executable. A sanity check will be added to this.

The easybuild file fmaral-1.0.0-2019.03-foss-2018b-Python-3.6.6.eb uses this nlplpython.py easyblock.


 
##To access, test installation on saga.sigma2.no

export MODULEPATH=/cluster/work/support/easybuild/modules/all:$MODULEPATH
Then use :
module avail <module name>

e.g.
module avail nltk/3.4.5-foss-2016b-Python-3.5.2
